# Web4AGI — Open Agentic Spatial Operating System

> Metaverse based parcel agents with verified check-ins, USD stablecoin incentives, and LangGraph-powered optimization.

Web4AGI is an open spatial internet platform for San Francisco. It turns every real-world parcel into an autonomous agent that can hold a wallet, trade with others, and optimize community engagement using open standards (MCP, NANDA, x402).

## Core Architecture
- **Data & Spatial Fabric**: OSM + parcels + underground utilities + Stikk loyalty spots.
- **Agent Interfaces (MCP)**: Universal tool interfaces for spatial data, agents, and exchange.
- **Agent Registry (NANDA)**: Verifiable discovery of capability and parcel agents.
- **Economic Layer (UEL)**: USD-stablecoin contracts and attestation via x402/XYO protocols.
- **Optimization (LangGraph)**: Multi-agent workflows for parcel-level reasoning.
- **Experience Layer**: WebXR Metaverse Browser for AR/VR interaction.

## Key Components
- **SpatialFabricServer**: Place hierarchy, parcel lookups, and routing.
- **ParcelAgentServer**: Management of per-parcel state, goals, and recommendations.
- **ExchangeServer**: USD stablecoin wallets and incentive contract settlement.
- **Route.X**: The unified MCP orchestration and routing front door.

## Getting Started
1. **Explore the MCP Tools**: See `mcp-tools.json` for the unified parcel API.
2. **Configure Corridors**: Edit `corridor-config.json` to define geographic scope.
3. **Register Agents**: Use the NANDA AgentFacts templates in `/agents`.
